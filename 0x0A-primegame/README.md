Project Objectives

This repository intends to demonstrate an understanding of python by simulating a game where Maria and Ben are given a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including n, they take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from the set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game.
