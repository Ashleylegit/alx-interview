Project Objectives<br><br>

This repository intends to demonstrate an understanding of the Python programming language with the following concept:<br>
In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.<br>
* Prototype: def minOperations(n)<br>
* Returns an integer<br>
* If n is impossible to achieve, return 0
