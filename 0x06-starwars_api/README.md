Project Objectives<br><br>

This repository intends to demonstrate an understanding of the JavaScript programming language by writing a script that prints all characters of a Star Wars movie:<br>
* The first positional argument passed is the Movie ID - example: 3 = “Return of the Jedi”<br>
* Display one character name per line in the same order as the “characters” list in the /films/ endpoint<br>
* You must use the Star wars API<br>
* You must use the request module
